Data Visualization: Mostly used numerical methods as the number of data is quite big for graphs and specification.\n","\n","2.

For Lost Reason and Lease I have used sentiment analysis and information extraction with dimensionality reduction to get to the crux of features\n","\n","4. I have chosen to drop movein feature as from the given features it is not fruitful to consider exact dates without initial timeline\n","\n","5. For location data, I have used aggregate methods because after analysis it was found that data was concentrated.\n","\n","6. For financial data, regex function and simple average method is used\n","\n","6. For Imbalance in dataset SMOTE has been performed in order to avoid overfitting.\n","\n","7. For scoring method, I have gone with Machine Learning model prediction and getting the probability of getting 1 as score of the lead.\n","\n","8. Each specification of as to why that particular method and way had been used, is mentioned by using commenting method\n","\n","9. For website traffic data, as it was widely distributed with exception of only one pair of medium-source derving most traffic, I have used PCA to extract information from that axis."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1768,"status":"ok","timestamp":1676627044376,"user":{"displayName":"JAY PIPLODIYA","userId":"14939563265460868058"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"XQDAh4s0xPxD"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np \n","import seaborn as sns\n","import re\n","import math\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1676627044377,"user":{"displayName":"JAY PIPLODIYA","userId":"14939563265460868058"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"F9DKmc1hHaYd"},"outputs":[],"source":["pd.set_option(\"display.max_colwidth\", 20)\n","pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 20)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":730},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":493,"status":"ok","timestamp":1676627044863,"user":{"displayName":"JAY PIPLODIYA","userId":"14939563265460868058"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"xV0iJuERxwGN","outputId":"5f196f38-5e87-4446-b897-27f7352c8b27"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","  \u003cdiv id=\"df-e225f661-bf65-4f1c-9505-71af5103c00b\"\u003e\n","    \u003cdiv class=\"colab-df-container\"\u003e\n","      \u003cdiv\u003e\n","\u003cstyle scoped\u003e\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","\u003c/style\u003e\n","\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n","  \u003cthead\u003e\n","    \u003ctr style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eID\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eAgent_id\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003estatus\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003elost_reason\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003ebudget\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003elease\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003emovein\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003esource\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003esource_city\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003esource_country\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eutm_source\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eutm_medium\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003edes_city\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003edes_country\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eroom_type\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003elead_id\u003c/th\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","  \u003c/thead\u003e\n","  \u003ctbody\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e0\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1deba9e96f404694...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eLOST\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNot responding\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9b2d5b4678781e53...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9b2d5b4678781e53...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9b2d5b4678781e53...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e3d59f7548e1af215...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e268ad70eb5bc4737...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eecc0e7dc084f141b...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e8d23a6e37e0a6431...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003ecd5dc0d9393f3980...\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e299ae77a4ef350ae...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eLOST\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eLow budget\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9b2d5b4678781e53...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9b2d5b4678781e53...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e9b2d5b4678781e53...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e3d59f7548e1af215...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e268ad70eb5bc4737...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e5372372f3bf58968...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e8d23a6e37e0a6431...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNaN\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eb94693673a5f7178...\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e2\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003ec213697430c00601...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eLOST\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNot responding\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e£121 -
